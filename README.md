# Project Summary 

In this mini-project, we will expand upon the application we created during React-1 and React-2, while introducing ```axios```. We'll cover full ```CRUD``` in this project (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) and also cover how to use ```.then()```. A majority of the application will already be built for you. If you're finding it hard to dive into an existing code base and understanding what is going on, that's pefectly normal. Try to focus only on how we're interacting with the API using axios. 

This project is also incorporating toast notifications to help visualize successful or failed API requests. Therefore when building out our ```axios``` requests, we will add an additional line of code for successful and failed API requests.

* Success: ```toast.success("Success!");```
* Failure: ```toast.error("Failed!");```
