1) Since we are using the products array that includes Image URL's, should I remove the assets folder?

2) Am I okay using the spread operator in the addProduct method (Line 26) or would you prefer me to copy the state, push the newItem into the copy and then set state with the copy?

3) Should the clear cart have an additional message for the name length or only if it's empty?

4) Students will be doing create-react-app from scratch for react-1 so should we include a step where we give them the CSS and they just copy and paste? 

    - If so, is there anything specific with the CSS that you care about? What to include or what not to?
